transmitter
	finite buffer: holds packets to be transmitted into link
	link processor: transmits packets into link
		packets arrive randomly
		time between packets follows distribution function
		time to transmit a packet depends on its size

	2 cases
		1. transmitter is idle (0 packets)
			arriving packet given to link processor
			link processor transmits packet
		2. transmitter is busy transmitting another packet & there are 0 or more packets waiting in buffer
			packet queued in buffer
			while (buffer not empty)
				lp retrieves 1 packet at a time from buffer in fifo order, transmits to link

discrete event simulation
	given
		packet inter-arrival times
		distribution of packet transmission times
	find
		avg number of packets in buffer
		total num of dropped packets (buffer is full)
		% of time link processor is busy (not idle) = link processor utilization
	time proceeds in dicrete steps associated w key events
	the events
		arrival of packet
		departure of packet

queue
	MAXBUFFER max packets (can be infinite)
	only 1 arrival at a time
	inter-arrival time follows negative exponential dist with rate lambda packets/second

server
	transmits 1 packet at a time (fifo)
	packet length varies & transmission time varies
	transmission time is neg ex dist with rate mu packets/second
